# NodeSQLAmazon
a bootleg amazon application using node and sql as a database!

# Purpose
The point of the program is to be able to act in somewhat of an amazon fashion,
where a user is able to "purchase" an item, and after purchasing, the quantity should go down
based off of the amount that the user purchases. 

# Detail
When running the program, the user will be prompted with a table of the items.
The table will of course display the number item, the name, the department, and other
data pertaining to the item. 

### Further Functionality!
I am going to create a method with which there is going to be "manager access" as well as
"supervisor access". These two separate methods will share a similar javascript file, the only
difference is the functionality between the two and the original "BamazonCustomer" js file.
This should add a more "realistic" feel to it.

###### Extra Stuff
I had an idea in mind to keep myself busy where if I get this done early, I will attach whatever I can
to an actual html and see if I can get the thing up and running with the database. 

###### To Do:
1. Give the javascript file a way to interact with the database
2. Upon Connecting to the Database, Display the information regularly,
3. Apply a table, this part, we were instructed to do a little research on npm for creating a table in the terminal
4. Give the user a way to access each item via item_id
5. Give the user the ability to Take an item, and more than one after that
6. Create the manager version where the user is able to add, remove, and edit items on the list
7. TBD
